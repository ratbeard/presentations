slides for my presentations

Assuming you're using textmateâ€¦

Files are grouped in to topics.  
To make a file per slide (presentation mode) run:

  rake build
  
  
To open all the slides in order run:

  mate slides
  rake open
  
  
now use 

  cmd+opt+arrows        move through slides
  
i've got a custom bundle to copy the current line or slide to the clipboard i should post.  And setup some quicksilver hotkeys to switch between textmate and terminal!  enjoy!
